# PHP Gift card app

This application was created as a part of my YouTube coding challenge. It is an app that a store can use to create and manage gift cards.

Gift cards can be printed as PDF's and a barcode will be printed on the PDF, so that it can easily be read with a barcode scanner.

The gift card code can then be checked to see if it has balance left, and it can be used with a specific balance, which will substract the gift card's available balance.
